# Vaporwave Processing Sketch

My submission for the first assignment for SETU's HDip in Computer Science. It is a sketch written in Processing, inspired by vaporwave art.

## Technologies Used

This sketch has been created using Processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Processing

### Project Setup

- Open the project directory in Processing. Press run, and use your mouse or touchpad's scroll to randomise the image. You can also use the left mouse button to create a vaporwave background. Right click to save the image as a .png in the directory.
